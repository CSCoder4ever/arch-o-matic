Various Arch install scripts I've made for my own purpose, fork as you wish!

#To use them: 

Boot into the Arch image with either a CD or Flash drive.
connect to network ( skip if using wired ):
<code>wifi-menu</code>

Install Git:
<code>pacman -Sy git</code>

clone:
<code>git clone http://github.com/CSCoder4ever/arch-o-matic.git</code>

change over to the newly cloned repo:
<code>cd arch-o-matic</code>

decide what type of script you'll want:
<code>cd server 
#desktop laptop
<code>

execute part1 of script:
<code>sh archInstallScriptPart1.sh</code>

and have fun.
