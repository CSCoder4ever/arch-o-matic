Various Arch install scripts I've made for my own purpose, fork as you wish!

#To use them: 

start out with copying the installation scripts to a flash drive.
then boot to an arch image via a CD ( working out the bugs with flash drive boot up ).

in the Arch bootable media, make a directory called USB: mkdir USB

mount your flash drive to the USB directory ( mine was /dev/sdb1 ): mount /dev/sdb1 USB

change over to the directory: cd USB

execute the script that you want to execute: sh nameOfScript.sh 

and have fun.
